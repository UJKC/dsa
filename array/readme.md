Array operations are fundamental in programming, especially in languages like Python, JavaScript, and others. Here's an overview of some common array operations:

1. **Accessing Elements**: Accessing elements of an array using index notation. For example, `array[0]` to access the first element.

2. **Insertion**: Adding elements to an array. This can be done at the beginning, end, or any specific position within the array.

3. **Deletion**: Removing elements from an array. This can also be done from any specific position within the array.

4. **Updating**: Modifying the value of an element at a particular index in the array.

5. **Traversal**: Iterating through all the elements of an array, usually using loops like for or while.

6. **Concatenation**: Combining two arrays to create a new array containing elements of both arrays.

7. **Slicing**: Extracting a subset of elements from an array based on a range of indices.

8. **Searching**: Finding the index of a particular element in the array.

9. **Sorting**: Arranging the elements of the array in a specified order, such as ascending or descending.

10. **Filtering**: Creating a new array containing only those elements of the original array that satisfy a certain condition.

11. **Mapping**: Applying a function to each element of the array to create a new array of transformed elements.

These operations are foundational to working with arrays efficiently and effectively in programming. Different programming languages may have different syntax and built-in functions for these operations, but the concepts remain largely the same.
