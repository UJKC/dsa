Linked lists are fundamental data structures in computer science. They consist of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next element in the sequence. Here are some common operations performed on linked lists:

1. **Insertion**: Adding a new element to the linked list.
   - Insertion at the beginning.
   - Insertion at the end.
   - Insertion at a specific position.
   
2. **Deletion**: Removing an element from the linked list.
   - Deletion from the beginning.
   - Deletion from the end.
   - Deletion from a specific position.
   
3. **Traversal**: Visiting each element of the linked list to perform operations such as printing or searching.

4. **Searching**: Finding a specific element in the linked list.

5. **Accessing**: Accessing elements of the linked list by index, although this operation is less common and less efficient in linked lists compared to arrays.

6. **Concatenation**: Combining two linked lists to create a single linked list.

7. **Reversal**: Reversing the order of elements in the linked list.

8. **Sorting**: Sorting the elements of the linked list, either using algorithms like merge sort or bubble sort, or by first converting the linked list to an array, sorting the array, and then reconstructing the linked list.

9. **Merging**: Merging two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.

10. **Size/Length**: Computing the number of elements in the linked list.

11. **Update**: Update the number

These operations form the basis for manipulating linked lists in various applications. Depending on the specific implementation of linked lists (e.g., singly linked list, doubly linked list), the complexity of these operations may vary. Implementing these operations involves manipulating pointers/references to maintain the structure of the linked list correctly.
